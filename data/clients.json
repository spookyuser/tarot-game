    "story": "Maria lost her husband to the winter sea. She runs his vineyard alone now, but creditors close in. {0} The vines hang heavy in the autumn air, waiting for hands that may never come.\n\nA letter from the creditors sits unopened on the table, its seal like a wound. {1} She traces the wax with her thumbnail, feeling it crack beneath the pressure.\n\nThe harvest moon rises over the vineyard. {2} Maria has made her choice."
